# Blackjack Monte Carlo Simulation

This repo contains code for a Monte-Carlo Simulation of Blackjack.

## Inspiration

During the Lunar New Year, I noticed that my friend was losing a bunch of money while playing as the dealer. Naturally, this made me curious and I sought to find out if the version of blackjack we were playing is actually fair. This led me to write some code to answer some questions:

- What is the expected value for different rulesets of blackjack?
- How effective the Martingale betting system in blacjack?
- What is the optimal strategy for winning as a player / dealer?

## Contribution

Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you wish to improve upon the implementation.

## Notes

The code also serves as OOP practice for me.
